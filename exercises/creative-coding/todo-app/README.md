# To-Do List App

## Overview

This exercise guides you through building a classic To-Do list application using GitHub Copilot. You'll experience how Copilot can accelerate development by generating code and suggestions based on your natural language prompts.

You are free to choose any programming language you are comfortable with to complete this exercise. The goal is to create a functional To-Do list that allows users to manage their tasks effectively.
You can choose any language you wish to use to complete this exercise. 

## Learning Objectives

* Practice using GitHub Copilot to generate code from user stories and prompts.
* Develop a basic understanding of front-end or back-end development (depending on your language choice).
* Learn how to implement core functionalities such as adding, completing, and deleting items.
* Explore optional features like editing, filtering, and data persistence.

## Getting Started

1.  **Choose a Programming Language:** Select your preferred programming language (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Java, Go).
2.  **Create a Repository:** Initialize a new Git repository on GitHub.
3.  **Create Project Files:** Set up your project structure and create the necessary files (e.g., `index.html`, `app.js`, `main.py`).
4.  **Start Coding with Copilot:** Begin writing comments or code, and let Copilot assist you with suggestions.

## User Stories

Use these user stories to craft your prompts for GitHub Copilot:

-   [ ] User can see an `input` field where he can type in a to-do item
-   [ ] By pressing enter (or a button), the User can submit the to-do item and can see that being added to a list of to-do's
-   [ ] User can mark a to-do as `completed`
-   [ ] User can remove a to-do item by pressing on a button (or on the to-do item itself)

## Bonus features
-   [ ] User can edit a to-do
-   [ ] User can see a list with all the completed to-do's
-   [ ] User can see a list with all the active to-do's
-   [ ] User can see the date when he created the to-do
-   [ ] When closing the browser window the to-do's will be stored and when the User returns, the data will be retrieved

## Exercise Steps 

1.  **Input and Display:** Implement the input field and the display area for to-do items.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Create an input field for to-do items.`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Display the to-do items in a list.`
2.  **Add To-Do Items:** Implement the functionality to add new to-do items to the list.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Add a function to add a new to-do item.`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Add an event listener to the input field or button.`
3.  **Mark as Completed:** Implement the functionality to mark to-do items as completed.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Add a checkbox or button to mark a to-do item as completed.`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Update the to-do item's status when marked as completed.`
4.  **Remove To-Do Items:** Implement the functionality to remove to-do items from the list.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Add a button or functionality to remove a to-do item.`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Remove the to-do item from the list.`

## Bonus Features (Optional)

* **Edit To-Do Items:** Allow users to edit existing to-do items.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Add functionality to edit a to-do item.`
* **Completed To-Do List:** Display a separate list of completed to-do items.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Create a separate list for completed to-do items.`
* **Active To-Do List:** Display a list of active (uncompleted) to-do items.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Create a separate list for active to-do items.`
* **Creation Date:** Display the date and time when a to-do item was created.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Add a timestamp to each to-do item.`
* **Data Persistence (localStorage/File Storage):** Store to-do items in the browser's `localStorage` (for web) or a file (for other languages) to persist data across sessions.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Save the to-do items to localStorage.`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Load the to-do items from localStorage.`

## Tips for Using Copilot

* **Use Clear Comments:** Describe the functionality you want in comments.
* **Break Down Tasks:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
* **Iterate and Refine:** Review and adjust the generated code as needed.
* **Experiment with Prompts:** Try different ways of phrasing your prompts.

## Submission

Once you've completed the exercise, commit your code to your GitHub repository and share the repository link.

Have fun building your To-Do list application with GitHub Copilot!
