# Meal Plan Generator 

## Overview

This exercise challenges you to leverage GitHub Copilot to build a simple meal plan generator. 
The goal is to experience how Copilot can assist in rapidly prototyping and developing functional code, even with minimal initial requirements.

You'll be tasked with creating a program that generates a meal plan for a specified number of days, potentially incorporating user preferences and dietary restrictions.

## Learning Objectives

* Become familiar with using GitHub Copilot for code generation and suggestions.
* Learn to guide Copilot through natural language prompts.
* Understand how to iterate and refine Copilot's output.
* Gain experience in breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
* Practice basic data structures and algorithms in your chosen programming language.

## Getting Started

1.  **Choose a Programming Language:** Select a language you're comfortable with (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java).
2.  **Create a Repository:** Initialize a new Git repository on GitHub.
3.  **Create a File:** Create a file for your meal plan generator (e.g., `meal_planner.py`, `meal_planner.js`).
4.  **Start Coding with Copilot:** Begin writing comments or code, and let Copilot assist you.

## User Stories

-   [ ] I want to generate a meal plan for 7 days, so I don't have to plan my meals manually.
-   [ ] I want to specify the number of days for my meal plan, so I can customize it to my needs.
-   [ ] I want to include specific meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner), so I can have a complete plan.
-   [ ] I want to add a list of available recipes, so the meal plan is generated from those recipes.**
-   [ ] I want to filter recipes based on dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free), so I can accommodate my dietary needs.
-   [ ] I want to specify a calorie range, so the meals fit within my daily calorie goals.
-   [ ] I want to be able to save my generated meal plan, so I can access it later.
-   [ ] I want to be able to randomly generate a meal plan, so I can try something new.
-   [ ] I want to be able to view the ingredients for each meal, so I can easily shop for them.
-   [ ] I want to be able to view cooking instructions for each meal, so I can easily prepare them.

## Exercise Steps

1.  **Basic Meal Plan:** Start by generating a simple meal plan for a fixed number of days with placeholder meals.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Generate a meal plan for 7 days.`
2.  **User-Specified Days:** Allow the user to input the number of days for the meal plan.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Ask the user for the number of days for the meal plan.`
3.  **Meal Types:** Include breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the meal plan.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Generate a meal plan with breakfast, lunch, and dinner for each day.`
4.  **Recipe List:** Create a list of sample recipes and use them to populate the meal plan.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Create a list of sample recipes.`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Generate a meal plan using the sample recipes.`
5.  **Dietary Restrictions:** Implement filtering based on dietary restrictions.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Ask the user for dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free).`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Filter the recipes based on the user's dietary restrictions.`
6.  **Calorie Range:** Allow the user to specify a calorie range.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Ask the user for a calorie range.`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Filter recipes to fit within the calorie range.`
7.  **Save/Load:** Add functionality to save and load meal plans.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Add functionality to save the meal plan to a file.`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// Add functionality to load a meal plan from a file.`
8.  **Ingredients and Instructions:** Add ingredients and cooking instructions to the meal plan output.
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// add ingredients to each meal`
    * Prompt Copilot with: `// add cooking instructions to each meal`

## Tips for Using Copilot

* **Be Descriptive:** Use clear and specific comments to guide Copilot.
* **Break Down Tasks:** Divide the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
* **Iterate and Refine:** Don't expect Copilot to generate perfect code on the first try. Refine and adjust its suggestions.
* **Experiment:** Try different prompts and approaches to see what works best.
* **Review and Understand:** Always review the generated code to ensure it meets your requirements and is understandable.

## Submission

Once you've completed the exercise, commit your code to your GitHub repository and share the repository link.

## Further Exploration

* Implement a user interface (GUI or web-based).
* Integrate with a recipe API for a larger recipe database.
* Add nutritional information to the meal plan.
* Add a grocery list generator.
* Implement a shopping list export.

Have fun and happy coding with GitHub Copilot!
